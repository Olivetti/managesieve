Announcing:

                          managesieve
                         =============
                          Version 0.3


A MANGAGESIEVE client library for remotely managing Sieve scripts,
including an interactive 'sieveshell'.

This module allows accessing a Sieve-Server for managing Sieve scripts
there. For more information about the MANAGESIEVE protocol see draft
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-martin-managesieve-04.txt .

Changes since 0.2
-----------------
* managesieve:
  - MANAGESIEVE.authenticate() now only returns a OK/NO/BYE result
    like any command not asking data from the server

* sieveshell:
  - added 'edit', which may create scripts, too. (posix only)
  - now prints out the server capabilities, thus the user knows what
    ther server is capable of (and which Sieve-Commands may be used).
  - fixed some minor bugs


What is MANAGESIEVE?
--------------------

Sieve scripts allow users to filter incoming email. Message stores are
commonly sealed servers so users cannot log into them, yet users must
be able to update their scripts on them. This module implements a
protocol "managesieve" for securely managing Sieve scripts on a remote
server. This protocol allows a user to have multiple scripts, and also
alerts a user to syntactically flawed scripts.

This an interim measure as it is hoped that eventually Sieve scripts
will be stored on ACAP.
