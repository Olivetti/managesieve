                          managesieve
                         =============
                          Version 0.4


A MANGAGESIEVE client library for remotely managing Sieve scripts,
including an interactive 'sieveshell'.

This module allows accessing a Sieve-Server for managing Sieve scripts
there. For more information about the MANAGESIEVE protocol see draft
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-martin-managesieve-04.txt .

Changes since 0.3
-----------------
* managesieve:
  - now work with Python 2.3 and later
  - added support for TLS (STARTTLS)
  - added support for PLAIN authentication
  - use optparse if available instead of optik.
  - API change: login() no longer uses the LOGIN authentication
    mechanism, but has become a convenient function. It uses the best
    mechanism available for authenticating the user.
  - Several Bugfixes, see HISTORY for details.

  Thanks to Tomas 'Skitta' Lindroos, Lorenzo Boccaccia, Alain Spineux,
  darkness and Gregory Boyce for sending patches.

* sieveshell:
  - added support for different authentication mechanisms
  - added option --start-tls
  - several other enhancements and bugfixes


What is MANAGESIEVE?
--------------------

Sieve scripts allow users to filter incoming email. Message stores are
commonly sealed servers so users cannot log into them, yet users must
be able to update their scripts on them. This module implements a
protocol "managesieve" for securely managing Sieve scripts on a remote
server. This protocol allows a user to have multiple scripts, and also
alerts a user to syntactically flawed scripts.

This an interim measure as it is hoped that eventually Sieve scripts
will be stored on ACAP.
