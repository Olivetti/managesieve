Description: 
        A MANGAGESIEVE client library for remotely managing Sieve scripts,
        including an interactive 'sieveshell'.
        
        This module allows accessing a Sieve-Server for managing Sieve scripts
        there. For more information about the MANAGESIEVE protocol see draft
        http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-martin-managesieve-04.txt .
        
        
        What is MANAGESIEVE?
        --------------------
        
        Sieve scripts allow users to filter incoming email. Message stores are
        commonly sealed servers so users cannot log into them, yet users must
        be able to update their scripts on them. This module implements a
        protocol "managesieve" for securely managing Sieve scripts on a remote
        server. This protocol allows a user to have multiple scripts, and also
        alerts a user to syntactically flawed scripts.
        
        This an interim measure as it is hoped that eventually Sieve scripts
        will be stored on ACAP.
